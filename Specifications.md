## Organization Configuration

### Organization Email Settings
Each organization requires configuration of notification email addresses in the admin backend:

#### Required Email Fields
- **Procurement Team Email:** Email address for procurement notifications
  - Used for: All PR/PO notifications where procurement is recipient or CC
  - Example: procurement@1pwrafrica.com or procurement-lesotho@1pwrafrica.com
- **Asset Management Email:** Email address for asset management team
  - Used for: Notifications from ORDERED status onward (CC on all)
  - Example: assets@1pwrafrica.com or assets-lesotho@1pwrafrica.com
- **Organization Admin Email:** Primary administrative contact
  - Used for: Status change notifications, escalations
  - Example: admin@1pwrafrica.com

#### Configuration Requirements
- Emails should NOT be hardcoded in the application
- Each organization can have different email addresses
- Admin backend should provide interface to set/update these emails
- Validation: Email format must be valid
- Default: If not set, system should show warning but allow operation

#### Email Address Management
- Stored in organization document in Firestore
- Accessible by Level 1 (Administrator) only
- Can be updated through Admin Dashboard
- Changes logged in audit trail
- Multiple emails can be separated by comma for group notifications

### Organization Data Model Fields
Each organization document should include:
- **Basic Information:**
  - Organization ID (normalized: lowercase, underscores)
  - Organization name
  - Currency (base currency for the organization)
  - Active status
- **Notification Email Addresses:**
  - `procurementEmail`: Email for procurement team
  - `assetManagementEmail`: Email for asset management team
  - `adminEmail`: Email for organization administrator
- **Business Rules Configuration:**
  - Rule 1 threshold amount
  - Rule 2 threshold amount
  - Allowed currencies
- **Vendor Approval Duration Settings (Configurable):**
  - `vendorApproval3QuoteDuration`: Duration in months for auto-approval from 3-quote process (default: 12)
  - `vendorApprovalCompletedDuration`: Duration in months for auto-approval from any completed order (default: 6)
  - `vendorApprovalManualDuration`: Duration in months for manual approval (default: 12)
  - **Purpose:** Configurable timeframes prevent perpetual approval status
  - **System Behavior:** 
    - Expiry dates calculated dynamically from approval date + configured duration
    - Daily automated job checks expiry dates and auto-deactivates expired approvals
    - Justification validation checks use configured durations to determine eligibility
- **High-Value Vendor Approval Rules (Configurable):**
  - `highValueVendorMultiplier` (X): Multiplier of Rule 2 threshold for high-value vendor classification (default: 10)
    - Example: If Rule 2 = $10,000 and X = 10, vendors with cumulative orders â‰¥ $100,000 are high-value
  - `highValueVendorMaxDuration` (Z): Maximum approval duration for high-value vendors without 3-quote or manual override (default: 24)
  - **Purpose:** High-value vendors require stricter validation and regular competitive evaluation
  - **System Behavior:**
    - System calculates cumulative completed order value per vendor
    - If cumulative value â‰¥ (Rule 2 threshold Ã— X multiplier):
      - Vendor classified as "High-Value Vendor"
      - Maximum approval duration = Z months (regardless of how it was approved)
      - UNLESS vendor passed 3-quote process within previous `vendorApproval3QuoteDuration` months (reuses existing setting)
      - OR manual override with justification applied
    - High-value status displayed on vendor profile
    - Procurement notified when high-value vendor approval expires
  - **Note:** System reuses `vendorApproval3QuoteDuration` to determine 3-quote recency window - no separate parameter needed
- **Other Settings:**
  - Time zone
  - Business days configuration
  - Holiday calendar

### Special Department: Asset Management
Users assigned to the Asset Management department have special permissions:
- **In ORDERED Status:**
  - Can upload delivery documentation (delivery note, photos)
  - Can set override for delivery documentation (with justification)
  - Can move PO from ORDERED to COMPLETED status
- **Notifications:**
  - Asset Management email is CC'd on all PO notifications from ORDERED status onward
  - Receive daily reminders for POs in ORDERED status awaiting delivery documentation
- **Department Identification:**
  - Department field = "Asset Management" or similar asset tracking/management designation
  - Organization's `assetManagementEmail` used for group notifications

## Reference Data Management

### Collection Structure
- All reference data is stored in collections with prefix "referenceData_"
- Example: departments are stored in "referenceData_departments"

### ID Generation and Standardization
- Reference data items of type currencies, UOM, and organizations use their code as their ID
  - For these types, the code is converted to lowercase and any non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores
  - Example: A currency with code "USD" would have ID "usd"
- Organization IDs follow the same standardization rules:
  - Converted to lowercase
  - Spaces and special characters replaced with underscores
  - Example: "1PWR LESOTHO" becomes "1pwr_lesotho"
- Other reference data types use auto-generated IDs for better performance and uniqueness

### Organization References
- Most reference data items are associated with a specific organization, except:
  - Vendors (globally available across organizations)
  - Currencies (standard across system)
  - UOM (standard units of measure)
  - Organizations (represent the organizations themselves)
  - Permissions (system-wide settings)
- Organization association is implemented through a single `organizationId` field
  - The `organizationId` must reference a valid ID in the organizations collection
  - Organization details (name, currency, etc.) should be fetched from the organizations collection
  - Example: A vehicle with `organizationId: "1pwr_lesotho"` references the organization document with ID "1pwr_lesotho"

### Collection References
- Collections should maintain clean references to related documents
- Best practices for references:
  - Use standardized IDs for consistency
  - Store only the reference ID, not the entire referenced document
  - Fetch related document details when needed
  - Example: Vehicles store only organizationId, fetching organization details from the organizations collection when needed

### Data Normalization
- Avoid storing redundant data across collections
- Each piece of information should have a single source of truth
  - Organization details stored only in the organizations collection
  - Reference data items should only store IDs of related documents
- Updates to referenced data (e.g., organization name) only need to be made in one place

### Active Status
- All reference data items have an active status (boolean)
- Only active items are returned by the reference data service
- Inactive items are still stored but not available for selection
- This allows "soft deletion" of items that may be referenced by historical records

### Vendor Management

#### Vendor Approval Requirements and Automation

##### Minimum Information Requirements (All Approval Types):

  - **Renewal Conditions Not Met:** If vendor expires and has no qualifying recent orders, remains non-approved until:
    - New order completed successfully (auto-approves with new expiry), OR
    - Manual approval with justification

##### High-Value Vendor Special Rules
- **Classification Criteria:**
  - Vendor's cumulative completed order value â‰¥ (Rule 2 threshold Ã— configured multiplier X)
  - Example: Rule 2 = $10,000, X = 10 â†’ High-value if cumulative orders â‰¥ $100,000
  - System calculates cumulative value from all COMPLETED POs associated with vendor
  
- **Approval Duration Restrictions:**
  - **Maximum Duration:** Z months (configurable, default: 24) without special conditions
  - **Applies To:** All approval types (auto from orders, manual)
  - **Exceptions (Can Extend Beyond Z Months):**
    1. Vendor passed 3-quote process within previous `vendorApproval3QuoteDuration` months (reuses existing setting)
    2. Manual override with justification by Admin/Procurement/Finance
  
- **System Behavior:**
  - **On Order Completion:** System checks if vendor becomes or is high-value
  - **If High-Value:**
    - Approval duration = MIN(normal duration, Z months) unless exception applies
    - "High-Value Vendor" badge displayed on vendor profile
    - Approval expiry calculation considers high-value status
  - **Daily Check:** Automated job verifies high-value vendors meet continuation criteria
    - If Z months passed without 3-quote process within `vendorApproval3QuoteDuration` months and no override â†’ auto-deactivate
    - Notification sent to Procurement with recommendation to either:
      - Run competitive 3-quote process for next order
      - Provide manual override justification for continued approval
  
- **Configuration Parameters (in Organization Settings):**
  - `highValueVendorMultiplier` (X): Multiplier for classification (default: 10)
  - `highValueVendorMaxDuration` (Z): Max approval months for high-value vendors (default: 24)
  - **Reuses existing setting:** `vendorApproval3QuoteDuration` determines how recently vendor must have passed 3-quote process
  
- **Purpose:** Ensures high-spend vendors undergo regular competitive evaluation

  - Can view their own PR history
  - Basic access level for regular users
  - No administrative access

- ~~Level 6: Junior Approver~~ [DEPRECATED]
  - ~~Can approve PRs below Rule 1 threshold~~
  - ~~Organization assignment determines approval scope~~
  - ~~Cannot approve high-value PRs~~

### Organization Assignment
- Users can be assigned to one primary organization
- Additional organization access can be granted through the `additionalOrganizations` field
- Organization IDs are normalized for consistency:
  - Converted to lowercase
  - Special characters replaced with underscores
  - Example: "1PWR LESOTHO" becomes "1pwr_lesotho"
- Organization matching uses normalized IDs for comparison

## Approver System

### Approver Selection
- Approvers are filtered based on:
  - Active status (`isActive` must be true)
  - Permission level (APPROVER role)
  - Organization match (must be associated with the PR's organization)
- Organization matching includes:
  - Primary organization assignment
  - Additional organization assignments
- Organization matching uses normalized IDs to ensure consistent comparison
  - Example: "1PWR LESOTHO" and "1pwr_lesotho" are treated as the same organization

### Approver Display
- Approvers are shown in dropdowns with their full name
- The approver list is filtered to show only relevant approvers based on:
  - The PR's organization
  - The approver's organization assignments (primary and additional)
  - The approver's active status
- Inactive approvers are automatically excluded from selection

### Historical Records
- Approved PRs maintain their approver information even if:
  - The approver is later deactivated
  - The approver's organization assignments change
  - The approver's permission level changes
- This ensures audit trail integrity while preventing new selections of invalid approvers

### Organization Assignment
- Users can be assigned to one primary organization
- Additional organization access can be granted through the `additionalOrganizations` field
- Organization IDs are normalized for consistency:
  - Converted to lowercase
  - Special characters replaced with underscores
  - Example: "1PWR LESOTHO" becomes "1pwr_lesotho"
- Organization matching uses normalized IDs for comparison

## PR/PO Data Model Structure

### Core PR/PO Fields
- **id**: Unique identifier for the PR/PO
- **prNumber** / **poNumber**: Human-readable number (format: ORG-YYYYMM-XXX) - same number retained through lifecycle

- **supplierContact**: Contact information object containing:
  - **phone**: Phone number (optional)
  - **email**: Email address (optional)
  - **website**: Website URL (optional)
  - At least one contact method required
- **supplierDataEnteredBy**: User ID who entered the supplier data
- **supplierDataTimestamp**: When supplier data was entered

### Line Items Structure
- Each PR/PO contains an array of line items with:
  - **id**: Unique identifier for the line item
  - **description**: Description of the item
  - **quantity**: Number of items requested
  - **uom**: Unit of measure
  - **unitPrice**: Price per unit (from selected quote)
  - **totalPrice**: Total price for line item (quantity Ã— unitPrice)
  - **notes**: Optional additional information
  - **attachments**: Array of file attachments

### Approval Workflow Structure
- PRs use the `approver` field as the single source of truth for the designated approver:
  ```typescript
  interface PRRequest {
    approver: string;  // Current approver's user ID - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
    approver2?: string;  // Second approver's user ID (for dual-approval above Rule 2)
    requiresDualApproval: boolean;  // True if above Rule 2 threshold
    // other fields...
  }
  ```
- The `approvalWorkflow` field is used to track the history of approver changes:
  ```typescript
  interface ApprovalWorkflow {
    currentApprover: string;  // Mirror of the PR.approver field
    secondApprover?: string;  // Mirror of the PR.approver2 field (if dual-approval)
    requiresDualApproval: boolean;
    firstApprovalComplete: boolean;  // True when first approver has approved
    firstApproverJustification?: string;  // Justification from first approver (if 3-quote scenario)
    secondApprovalComplete: boolean;  // True when second approver has approved
    secondApproverJustification?: string;  // Justification from second approver (if 3-quote scenario)
    approvalHistory: ApprovalHistoryItem[];
    lastUpdated: string;
  }
  ```
- All code must respect the `pr.approver` and `pr.approver2` fields as the single source of truth:
  - The `pr.approver` and `pr.approver2` fields must never be automatically overridden
  - The `approvalWorkflow.currentApprover` and `approvalWorkflow.secondApprover` should always mirror these fields
  - The `approvalWorkflow.approvalHistory` tracks the complete history of approver changes
  - For dual-approval: Track which approver acted first, justifications from both

- Implementation requirements:
  1. Ensure all PR documents maintain `approver` (and `approver2` if applicable) as single source of truth
  2. Update all code to respect the manually set approver fields
  3. Ensure `approvalWorkflow` mirrors the approver fields
  4. Track all approver changes and both approvals in history
  5. Record approval justifications when 3 quotes are required

### PR/PO Status Workflow
- PRs (Purchase Requests) and POs (Purchase Orders) follow a defined status flow:
  - **SUBMITTED**: Initial state when PR is first created
  - **RESUBMITTED**: PR has been resubmitted after revision
  - **IN_QUEUE**: PR is in procurement queue for processing
  - **PENDING_APPROVAL**: PR awaiting approval from designated approver(s)
  - **APPROVED**: PR has been approved and becomes a PO (Purchase Order); ready for document processing
  - **ORDERED**: PO has been ordered (all required documents uploaded or overridden)
  - **COMPLETED**: PO has been fully processed and closed (all items received and documented)
  - **REVISION_REQUIRED**: Changes requested by procurement or approver
  - **CANCELED**: PR has been canceled by requestor only (can be resurrected to SUBMITTED)
  - **REJECTED**: PR has been rejected by procurement or approver (can be resurrected to highest previous status)

**Note:** From APPROVED status onward, the object is referred to as a PO (Purchase Order), not PR (Purchase Request).

### Standard Status Transitions
1. User creates PR â†’ Validation â†’ SUBMITTED (saved to database)
2. SUBMITTED â†’ Procurement review (status remains SUBMITTED, can edit most fields)
3. SUBMITTED â†’ [IN_QUEUE | REVISION_REQUIRED | REJECTED (by procurement)] (procurement decisions)
4. SUBMITTED â†’ CANCELED (requestor only)
5. IN_QUEUE â†’ PENDING_APPROVAL (procurement pushes to approver after quote validation)
6. IN_QUEUE â†’ CANCELED (requestor only)
7. PENDING_APPROVAL â†’ [APPROVED | REJECTED (by approver) | REVISION_REQUIRED]
8. PENDING_APPROVAL â†’ CANCELED (requestor only - up to and including this stage)
9. APPROVED â†’ Object renamed to PO, PO document generated
10. APPROVED (PO) â†’ ORDERED (procurement or finance/admin - after ETD and documents/overrides)
11. ORDERED (PO) â†’ COMPLETED (procurement or asset management or finance/admin for below Rule 1)
12. REVISION_REQUIRED â†’ RESUBMITTED â†’ SUBMITTED (re-enters workflow)
13. REVISION_REQUIRED â†’ CANCELED (requestor only)
14. REJECTED â†’ Can be resurrected by procurement/admin to highest previous status
15. CANCELED â†’ Can be resurrected by requestor to SUBMITTED status

## PR Workflow Implementation

### PR Processing in SUBMITTED Status
1. **Initial State After Validation:**
   - PR is validated before submission
   - Upon successful validation, PR is created in database with status SUBMITTED
   - Notification is automatically sent to procurement team
   - PR is viewable by all authorized users

2. **Who Can Take Actions in SUBMITTED Status:**
   - **Procurement Officers (Level 3):** Can review, edit, and make procurement decisions
   - **Administrators (Level 1):** Full access as superuser
   - **Other Permission Levels (2, 4, 5):** CANNOT take procurement actions in SUBMITTED stage
   - **Exception:** Requestor can cancel their own PR at any time

3. **Procurement Review and Editing (Level 3 or Level 1 only):**
   - Procurement team reviews PR while status remains SUBMITTED
   - Can edit most PR fields **EXCEPT** canonical fields and restricted financial fields:
     - Created by (requestor)
     - Created date
     - Last updated timestamp
     - Urgency level
     - Required date
     - **Project Category** (Finance/Admin only)
     - **Expense Type** (Finance/Admin only)
   - Can edit: Organization, Department, Description, Site, Estimated amount, Currency, Preferred vendor, Line items, Attachments
   - **Note:** Project Category and Expense Type can only be edited by Finance/Admin (Level 4) or Administrator (Level 1)

4. **Four Possible Actions from SUBMITTED:**
   - **Move to IN_QUEUE** (Procurement only): PR proceeds to quote validation and approver assignment
     - Notifies requestor, CC: Procurement
   - **Request Revision** (Procurement only - changes status to REVISION_REQUIRED):
     - Must provide notes (validated)
     - Notifies requestor, CC: Procurement
   - **Reject PR** (Procurement only - changes status to REJECTED):
     - Must provide notes (validated)
     - Notifies requestor, CC: Procurement
     - PR is not deleted from database
     - Can be resurrected by procurement/admin to SUBMITTED status
   - **Cancel PR** (Requestor only - changes status to CANCELED):
     - Optional notes
     - Notifies procurement
     - PR is not deleted from database
     - Can be resurrected by requestor to SUBMITTED status

### PR Processing in IN_QUEUE Status
1. **Procurement Edit Capabilities (Level 3 or Level 1 only):**
   - **Same edit permissions as SUBMITTED status**
   - Can edit most PR fields **EXCEPT** canonical fields and restricted financial fields:
     - Created by (requestor)
     - Created date
     - Last updated timestamp
     - Urgency level
     - Required date
     - **Project Category** (Finance/Admin only)
     - **Expense Type** (Finance/Admin only)
   - Can edit: Organization, Department, Description, Site, Estimated amount, Currency, Preferred vendor, Line items, Attachments
   - **Note:** Project Category and Expense Type can only be edited by Finance/Admin (Level 4) or Administrator (Level 1)
   - **Purpose:** May need to adjust PR details during quote validation and supplier data collection

2. **Supplier Data Collection (for non-approved vendors):**
   - For approved vendors: Data automatically referenced from system
   - For non-approved vendors: Procurement must manually input during IN_QUEUE:
     - Supplier name (required)
     - Contact information: phone OR email OR website (at least one required)
     - This data is NOT collected during PR creation
     - Validation check before moving to PENDING_APPROVAL
     - Data attached to PR object for audit trail

3. Procurement Users (permissionLevel 3 or 1):
   - Validate quotes and quote requirements
   - Collect supplier data for non-approved vendors
   - Select appropriate approver based on rules
   - Can "Push to Approver" (changes status to PENDING_APPROVAL)
   - Receive notifications about status changes

4. Requestor Users:
   - Can "Cancel PR" (changes status to CANCELED)
   - Optional notes when canceling
   - Receive notifications about status changes

5. Approvers:
   - Receive notification when PR is pushed for approval
   - Notification includes PR details (requestor, category, expense type, site, estimatedAmount, preferredVendor, requiredDate)
   - CC: Procurement (always)

### PR Processing in REVISION_REQUIRED Status
1. **Who Can Take Actions in REVISION_REQUIRED Status:**
   - **Requestor (Level 5):** Can edit their own PR and resubmit or cancel - **EXCLUSIVE ACCESS**
   - **Administrators (Level 1):** Full access as superuser (override capability)
   - **Procurement (Level 3):** CANNOT edit or take actions - must wait for requestor
   - **Finance/Admin (Level 4):** CANNOT edit or take actions - must wait for requestor
   - **Approvers (Level 2):** CANNOT edit or take actions - can only view

2. **Requestor Edit Capabilities in REVISION_REQUIRED:**
   - Can edit: Organization, Department, Description, Site, **Project Category**, **Expense Type**, Estimated Amount, Currency, **Urgency Level**, **Required Date**, Preferred Vendor, Line Items, Attachments
   - Cannot edit: Created by, Created date, History/Audit trail, PR Number
   - **CRITICAL:** In REVISION_REQUIRED status, the requestor has FULL edit access including Project Category and Expense Type
   - **Key Difference:** This is the ONLY status where requestor can edit Project Category and Expense Type
   - **Exclusive Access:** NO other user (except superadmin Level 1) can edit the PR in this status

3. **Two Possible Actions:**
   - **Resubmit:** Returns PR to SUBMITTED status for procurement review
   - **Cancel:** Changes status to CANCELED (requestor no longer wants to proceed)

### PR Resurrection Feature
PRs with REJECTED or CANCELED status can be restored to active workflow:

1. **Resurrection from REJECTED:**
   - **Who Can Resurrect:** Procurement Officers (Level 3) or Administrators (Level 1)
   - **Restore To:** The highest status the PR achieved before rejection
     - If rejected from SUBMITTED â†’ Restore to SUBMITTED
     - If rejected after reaching IN_QUEUE â†’ Restore to IN_QUEUE
     - If rejected from PENDING_APPROVAL â†’ Restore to PENDING_APPROVAL
   - **Use Case:** Rejection was made in error, or circumstances changed
   - **Notifications:** All stakeholders notified of resurrection
   - **History:** Rejection and resurrection both recorded in audit trail

2. **Resurrection from CANCELED:**
   - **Who Can Resurrect:** Original Requestor or Administrators (Level 1)
   - **Restore To:** SUBMITTED status ONLY (regardless of where canceled from)
   - **Use Case:** Requestor changed their mind or canceled by mistake
   - **After Resurrection:** PR returns to procurement review
   - **Notifications:** Procurement team notified of resurrection
   - **History:** Cancellation and resurrection both recorded in audit trail

3. **General Resurrection Rules:**
   - Resurrected PRs retain their original PR number
   - All history (rejection/cancellation reason, who, when) is preserved
   - Admin (Level 1) can resurrect any PR, regardless of who rejected/canceled it
   - Resurrection triggers automatic notifications to relevant stakeholders

### PR Action Components
- The workflow is implemented in the `ProcurementActions` component
- Action buttons are displayed based on user permissions and PR status
- Each action includes:
  - Visual confirmation dialog
  - Notes field (required for certain actions)
  - Automatic notification triggers

### Project Category and Expense Type Edit Permissions Summary

**Status-Based Permission Matrix:**

| Status | Who Can Edit Project Category & Expense Type |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| SUBMITTED | Procurement (L3), Finance/Admin (L4), or Admin (L1) |
| IN_QUEUE | Procurement (L3), Finance/Admin (L4), or Admin (L1) |
| **REVISION_REQUIRED** | **Requestor (L5) or Admin (L1) ONLY** |
| PENDING_APPROVAL | Procurement (L3), Finance/Admin (L4), or Admin (L1) |
| APPROVED | Procurement (L3), Finance/Admin (L4), or Admin (L1) |
| ORDERED | Procurement (L3), Finance/Admin (L4), or Admin (L1) |
| COMPLETED | Finance/Admin (L4) or Admin (L1) ONLY |

**Key Rules:**
1. **Procurement (Level 3) CAN edit** Project Category & Expense Type from SUBMITTED through ORDERED statuses
2. **Procurement (Level 3) CANNOT edit** these fields in COMPLETED status (Finance/Admin finalizes)
3. **Requestor (Level 5) can ONLY edit** these fields when their PR is in REVISION_REQUIRED status
4. **Finance/Admin (Level 4) can edit** these fields in all statuses EXCEPT REVISION_REQUIRED
5. **Admin (Level 1) can ALWAYS edit** as superuser override

**Rationale:**
- In SUBMITTED through ORDERED: Procurement actively processes and manages the PR lifecycle
- In REVISION_REQUIRED: Requestor must have full control to fix issues
- In COMPLETED: Only Finance/Admin can make final adjustments for audit/accounting purposes
- This allows Procurement to maintain proper categorization throughout their active workflow

### PR to PO Transition and APPROVED Status Processing

#### Object Rename at APPROVED Status
- When PR is approved, it is renamed to PO (Purchase Order)
- PO retains the same number as the PR (format: ORG-YYYYMM-XXX)
- System automatically generates a downloadable PO document containing:
  - All line items with quantities and prices
  - Reference to selected quotation
  - Vendor details
  - Delivery information
  - Approval details (approver names, dates, justifications if applicable)

#### Who Can Take Actions in APPROVED Status
- **Procurement Officers (Level 3):** Can perform all procurement and document management actions
- **Finance Admins (Level 4):** Can perform all finance and document management actions
- **Administrators (Level 1):** Full access to all actions (superuser)
- **Other Levels:** Cannot take actions in APPROVED status

#### Procurement Actions in APPROVED Status

  - Must upload PoP document
  - OR select override with justification note
  - Validation enforced before status change

#### Estimated Delivery Date (ETD) Requirement
- **Required for ALL POs** before moving to ORDERED status
- Must be entered by Procurement
- Used for:
  - Delivery tracking
  - Automatic delay notifications (if ORDERED > 3 business days after ETD)
  - Performance metrics
- Validation: System blocks ORDERED status change without ETD

#### Validation Checks Before ORDERED Status
Both Procurement and Finance/Admin must ensure:
1. **Estimated Delivery Date (ETD):** REQUIRED for all POs
2. **Proforma Invoice:** IF above Rule 1 - uploaded OR override with justification
3. **Proof of Payment:** IF above Rule 1 - uploaded OR override with justification
4. **Below Rule 1 Threshold:** Only ETD required - can move to ORDERED once ETD is entered
5. **Above Rule 1 Threshold:** ETD, Proforma, AND PoP all required (or overrides with justification)
6. System blocks status change if validation fails

#### Notifications in APPROVED Status
- **Notify Finance for Payment:** Procurement â†’ Finance Team (optional note)
- **Notify Procurement for Uploads:** Finance â†’ Procurement Team (optional note)

#### Status Change Notification: APPROVED â†’ ORDERED
When PO moves to ORDERED status:

  - All Approvers (single or both if dual-approval)
- **CC:** Procurement team (always), Organization Asset Management Email
- **Content:** PO number, status change, vendor details, order date, expected delivery (ETD), proforma/PoP status

**Note:** From ORDERED status onward, organization's Asset Management email is added to CC on all notifications.

### PO Processing in ORDERED Status

#### Who Can Take Actions in ORDERED Status
- **Procurement Officers (Level 3):** Can upload delivery documents, set override, move to COMPLETED
- **Asset Management Department Users:** Can upload delivery documents, set override, move to COMPLETED
  - User must have department = "Asset Management" or similar asset tracking role

     - **If 3-quote process:** Auto-approve vendor for 12 months
     - **If not 3-quote:** Auto-approve vendor for 6 months
     - Update vendor object with approval data
     - Log approval in vendor audit trail
   - **If "NO" selected:**
     - Log issue note to vendor record
     - **If override NOT checked:** Vendor remains non-approved
     - **If override checked:** Manually approve vendor with justification logged
   - Status moves to COMPLETED
   - Send notification to stakeholders

#### Automatic Delay Notification

- **Procurement Reminders:** For PRs in SUBMITTED or IN_QUEUE status; POs in APPROVED or ORDERED status
- **Approver Reminders:** For PRs in PENDING_APPROVAL status
- **Requestor Reminders:** For PRs in REVISION_REQUIRED status
- **Finance/Admin Reminders:** For POs in APPROVED status
- **Asset Management Reminders:** For POs in ORDERED status
- **Frequency:** Once daily at 8:00 AM
- **CC:** Procurement always copied on all reminders
- **Email Source:** Uses organization's configured `procurementEmail`, `assetManagementEmail` addresses

#### Urgent Reminder System (8:00 AM and 3:00 PM)
For PRs/POs pending action for MORE than 2 business days:
- **Escalated Frequency:** Twice daily (8:00 AM and 3:00 PM)
- **Subject:** Includes "URGENT" prefix
- **Content:** Highlights elapsed time and urgency
- **Recipients:** Same as daily reminders but with escalation notice
- **Calculation:** Business days only (excludes weekends and holidays)
- **Purpose:** Prevents PRs from stalling, ensures timely processing

#### Reminder Content
- List of PRs/POs pending action
- Days open for each PR/PO
- Specific action needed
- Link to view/act on each PR/PO
- Urgency indicator for items over 2 business days

### Approval Process

#### Single vs. Dual Approver Requirements
- **Below Rule 2 Threshold:** ONE approver required
  - Level 2 (if above Rule 1) OR Level 4 or Level 2 (if below Rule 1)
- **Above Rule 2 Threshold:** TWO Level 2 approvers required (concurrent)
  - Both approvers notified simultaneously
  - Approvers can review and act in any order (parallel review)
  - If one approver approves first, other approver is notified (1 of 2 complete)
  - Both must approve for PR to proceed to APPROVED status
  - If either approver rejects or requests revision at any time, process stops immediately
  - Other approver is notified when one approver acts

#### Approver Selection Based On:
- Department hierarchy
- Amount thresholds (Rule 1 and Rule 2)
- Special category rules
- Organization assignment

#### Approval Justification Requirements
Justification is ONLY required for PRs that require 3 quotes:

1. **When Justification is REQUIRED (3-Quote Scenarios):**
   - **Applies to:**
     - Above Rule 1 threshold with non-approved vendor (requires 3 quotes)
     - Above Rule 2 threshold (always requires 3 quotes)
   - **If Lowest Quote is Selected:**
     - Default justification option available: "Value for Money" (radio button)
     - OR approver can write custom justification note
   - **If Lowest Quote is NOT Selected:**
     - Custom justification REQUIRED (cannot use default)
     - Must explain why higher quote was chosen
     - System validates justification is provided
     - Common reasons: Better quality, faster delivery, better warranty, vendor reliability

2. **When Justification is NOT Required (1-Quote Scenarios):**
   - **Applies to:**
     - Below Rule 1 threshold (requires 1 quote)
     - Above Rule 1 threshold with approved vendor (requires 1 quote)
   - Approval process: Simple approval with optional notes
   - No justification validation enforced

3. **For Dual-Approval PRs (Above Rule 2 - Always 3 Quotes):**
   - BOTH approvers must provide justification
   - Both can use default "Value for Money" if lowest quote selected
   - Both must provide custom justification if non-lowest quote selected
   - Each approver's justification recorded independently
   - Both justifications preserved in approval history

#### Approval Workflow Tracking
The `approvalWorkflow` object tracks:
- Current approver information
- For dual-approval PRs: Both approver details
- Complete approval history with timestamps
- Approval justifications from each approver
- Which approver approved first (order captured but not enforced)
- Status: Pending both, One approved (waiting for second), Both approved
- Timestamps of each approval action

## PR Notifications System

### Cloud Function Integration
- PR notifications utilize Firebase Cloud Functions for email delivery
- The client-side `sendPRNotification` handler prepares notification data and calls the `sendPRNotification` cloud function
- The notification payload structure:
  ```typescript
  {
    notification: {
      prId: string;
      prNumber: string;
      oldStatus: string;
      newStatus: string;
      user: {
        email: string;
        name: string;
      };
      notes: string;
      metadata: {
        isUrgent?: boolean;
        description: string;
        amount: number;
        currency: string;
        department: string;
        requiredDate: string;
      };
    };
    recipients: string[];
    cc?: string[];
    emailBody: {
