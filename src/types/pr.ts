/**
 * @fileoverview Purchase Request Type Definitions
 * @version 2.0.0
 * 
 * Description:
 * Core type definitions for the Purchase Request (PR) system. These types define
 * the shape of data throughout the application, from database schema to UI components.
 * 
 * Data Model Notes:
 * The PR system follows a hierarchical structure:
 * - PRRequest: Root entity containing core PR data
 *   ├── LineItems: Individual items being requested
 *   ├── Quotes: Vendor quotes for the PR
 *   ├── Workflow: Approval and processing steps
 *   └── Metrics: Performance and status metrics
 * 
 * Status Flow:
 * SUBMITTED -> PENDING_APPROVAL -> [APPROVED | REJECTED] ->
 * [IN_QUEUE | REVISION_REQUIRED] -> ORDERED -> [PARTIALLY_RECEIVED | RECEIVED] -> COMPLETED
 * 
 * Related Modules:
 * - src/services/pr.ts: Main service using these types
 * - src/components/pr/*: UI components consuming these types
 * - Firestore: Database schema mirrors these types
