# PR System Email Notification System

## Recent Fixes (March 2025)

### Issues Fixed
1. **Eliminated Extraneous Email Headers**
   - Simplified the email headers to include only essential information
   - Removed unnecessary headers like X-Mozilla-Status that were causing display issues

2. **Improved Requestor Name Display**
   - Enhanced name resolution logic to properly display requestor's name in emails
   - Prioritized display order: name field → first+last name → email address

3. **Prevented Duplicate Email Recipients**
   - Implemented Set data structure to ensure unique email addresses in CC field
   - Added checks to prevent duplicate notifications for the same PR submission

4. **Duplicate Notification Prevention**
   - Added checks in both the submitPRNotification handler and the NewPRSubmittedHandler to prevent duplicate emails
   - Implemented cross-collection checks to ensure notifications aren't sent twice

### Implementation Details

#### Email Headers
- Simplified the email headers interface to include only essential fields
- Added custom X-PR-ID and X-PR-Number headers for tracking

#### Name Resolution
- Improved name resolution logic in all templates to follow a consistent pattern:
  1. First check for direct name field
  2. If not available, construct from first and last name
  3. Fall back to email as last resort

#### Duplicate Prevention
- Added checks against both notifications and purchaseRequestsNotifications collections
- Implemented Set data structure for CC recipients to ensure uniqueness

## Usage

The notification system follows this flow:
1. PR status changes trigger the appropriate notification handler
2. Handler determines recipients and generates email content
3. Email is sent via Firebase Cloud Functions
4. Notification is logged in the database

## Future Improvements
- Migrate to a more robust email delivery system
- Implement email templates with better responsive design
- Add user notification preferences
