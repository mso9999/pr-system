# PR Data Retrieval Fix - October 12, 2025

## Overview
Fixed critical bugs in PR data retrieval that prevented certain fields from displaying correctly in the PR view, despite being saved properly to Firestore.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Performance Issues from Excessive Logging
**Problem:** Excessive `console.log` statements throughout the codebase were causing significant performance degradation, particularly when loading PR views and reference data.

**Symptoms:**
- Slow page loads
- Sluggish rendering
- Browser console flooded with debug logs
- Potential memory issues from log accumulation

**Files Affected:**
- `src/components/pr/PRView.tsx` (~20 debug logs)
- `src/services/approver.ts` (~10 debug logs)
- `src/services/referenceData.ts` (~15 debug logs)

**Resolution:**
- Removed all non-essential `console.log` statements
- Kept `console.error` statements for actual error debugging
- Fixed improper `console.error` call in JSX expression

### 2. Missing Fields in PR Retrieval
**Problem:** The `getPR()` function in `src/services/pr.ts` was manually constructing the PR object field-by-field but was missing several important fields that were being saved during PR creation.

**Symptoms:**
- Preferred Vendor dropdown empty in PR view
- Vehicle field not displaying
- Data was being saved correctly but not retrieved

**Root Cause:**
The `getPR` function (lines 128-173) was explicitly listing fields to include, but `preferredVendor` and `vehicle` were omitted from the list.

**Resolution:**
Added the missing fields to the PR object construction:
```typescript
preferredVendor: data.preferredVendor || '',
vehicle: data.vehicle || '',
```

### 3. Required Date Not Displaying
**Problem:** The `requiredDate` field was being saved as a simple date string (e.g., `"2025-10-15"`) from the HTML date input, but the `getPR()` function was attempting to convert it using `safeTimestampToISO()`.

**Symptoms:**
- Required Date field showing "Not specified" even when a date was saved
- Date was in the database but not being read correctly

**Root Cause:**
The `safeTimestampToISO()` function expects either:
- A Firestore Timestamp object, OR
- A full ISO timestamp string like `"2025-10-15T12:00:00.000Z"`

Simple date strings like `"2025-10-15"` were failing validation and returning `undefined`.

**Resolution:**
Changed line 146 in `src/services/pr.ts` to handle simple date strings directly:
```typescript
// Before
requiredDate: safeTimestampToISO(data.requiredDate) || '',

// After
requiredDate: data.requiredDate || '', // Simple date string from HTML input, no conversion needed
```

## Testing Verification

### Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Performance:** Page loads and rendering should be significantly faster
2. **Preferred Vendor:** Should display the selected vendor name in view mode
3. **Vehicle:** Should display the selected vehicle in view mode (when expense type is vehicle)
4. **Required Date:** Should display the date in format MM/DD/YYYY
5. **UOM (Unit of Measure):** Should display labels like "Pieces" instead of codes like "PCS"

### Test Cases
1. Create a new PR with all fields populated
2. Submit the PR
3. View the PR in view mode
4. Verify all fields display correctly:
   - ✅ Preferred Vendor
   - ✅ Required Date
   - ✅ Vehicle (if applicable)
   - ✅ UOM labels in line items
   - ✅ All other fields

## Files Modified

### Primary Changes
1. `src/components/pr/PRView.tsx`
   - Removed excessive console.log statements
   - Fixed console.error in JSX expression

2. `src/services/pr.ts`
   - Added `preferredVendor` field to getPR (line 147)
   - Added `vehicle` field to getPR (line 148)
   - Fixed `requiredDate` handling (line 146)

3. `src/services/approver.ts`
   - Removed debug console.log statements from all service methods

4. `src/services/referenceData.ts`
   - Removed debug console.log statements from data fetching operations

## Impact Assessment

### User Impact
- **High Positive:** Significantly improved user experience with faster page loads
- **High Positive:** Critical fields now display correctly
- **No Breaking Changes:** All data was already being saved correctly

### Data Integrity
- ✅ No data migration needed
- ✅ Existing PRs will display correctly after code deployment
- ✅ No changes to data structure or schema

## Deployment Notes

### Rollout
1. Changes deployed via Git push to main branch
2. Vite dev server automatically hot-reloaded changes
3. No database updates required
4. No user action required

### Verification Steps
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Open existing PR
3. Verify all fields display
4. Create new PR and verify submission

## Lessons Learned

### Best Practices
1. **Avoid Excessive Logging:** Use console.log sparingly in production code
2. **Comprehensive Data Retrieval:** When manually constructing objects from Firestore, ensure all fields are included
3. **Type Consistency:** Be mindful of data type expectations (simple strings vs. timestamps)
4. **Testing Data Flow:** Test the complete cycle of save → retrieve → display

### Code Review Recommendations
1. Review all `getPR`-like functions for missing fields
2. Audit codebase for excessive console.log usage
3. Standardize date/timestamp handling across the application
4. Consider using spread operators (`...data`) instead of manual field mapping when appropriate
