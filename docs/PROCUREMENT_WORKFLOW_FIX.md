# Procurement Workflow Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The procurement workflow for processing submitted Purchase Requests (PRs) was not visible to procurement users, preventing them from performing essential actions like moving PRs to queue, rejecting, or requesting revisions.

## Root Cause
The procurement user's permission level had been reset from `3` (Procurement) to `5` (Requestor), which prevented the `ProcurementActions` component from rendering the workflow buttons.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Permission Level Fix
- **User**: phoka@1pwrafrica.com
- **Previous Permission Level**: 5 (Requestor)
- **Updated Permission Level**: 3 (Procurement)
- **Updated Role**: PROC (Procurement)

### 2. Cache Clearing
- Implemented force refresh functionality to clear cached authentication state
- Users experiencing permission issues can log out and log back in to refresh their permissions

### 3. Debugging Tools (Temporary)
- Added debug components to identify permission level issues
- Removed after successful resolution

## Procurement Workflow Actions

The procurement workflow provides the following actions based on PR status:

### For SUBMITTED/RESUBMITTED PRs:
- **Move to Queue** - Moves PR to procurement queue for processing
- **Reject** - Rejects the PR with notes
- **Revise & Resubmit** - Sends PR back to requestor for revision

### For IN_QUEUE PRs:
- **Push to Approver** - Moves PR to approval workflow
- **Reject** - Rejects the PR with notes
- **Revise & Resubmit** - Sends PR back for revision

### For REVISION_REQUIRED PRs:
- **Push to Approver** - Moves PR to approval workflow
- **Revise & Resubmit** - Sends PR back for additional revision

## Permission Levels Reference

## Files Modified

### Core Components:
- `src/components/pr/ProcurementActions.tsx` - Main procurement workflow component
- `src/components/pr/PRView.tsx` - PR details view with procurement actions

### Debug Components (Temporary):
- `src/components/debug/UserDebug.tsx` - User permission debugging
- `src/components/debug/ForceUserRefresh.tsx` - Force cache refresh

### Database Scripts:
- `scripts/fix-phoka-permissions.js` - Direct database permission update

## Testing Verification

✅ **Confirmed Working**:
- Procurement users can see workflow buttons on submitted PRs
- All three actions (Move to Queue, Reject, Revise & Resubmit) are functional
- Permission levels are correctly enforced
- User authentication state properly reflects updated permissions

## Prevention Measures

1. **Documentation**: This document serves as reference for future permission issues
2. **Debug Tools**: Debug components remain in codebase (commented out) for future troubleshooting
3. **Permission Monitoring**: Regular verification of procurement user permission levels

## Related Issues Fixed
