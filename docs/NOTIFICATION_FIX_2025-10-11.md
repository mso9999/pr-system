# Notification System Fix - October 11, 2025

## Summary
Fixed notification failures when PRs transition between certain statuses, particularly the `SUBMITTED->IN_QUEUE` transition. Also resolved dynamic import issues that were preventing PR submission notifications from being sent.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Status Transition Handlers
**Problem:** When pushing a PR from `SUBMITTED` to `IN_QUEUE` status, the system threw an error:
```
Error: No notification handler found for transition: SUBMITTED->IN_QUEUE
```

**Root Cause:** The `functionMap` in `NotificationService` was missing several status transition mappings.

**Solution:** Added missing transition handlers to the `functionMap`:
- `SUBMITTED->IN_QUEUE`
- `SUBMITTED->PENDING_APPROVAL`
- `IN_QUEUE->PENDING_APPROVAL`
- `IN_QUEUE->REJECTED`
- `IN_QUEUE->REVISION_REQUIRED`

### 2. Dynamic Import Failure for PR Submission Notifications
**Problem:** When submitting a new PR, the notification email failed to send with error:
```
Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://localhost:5173/src/services/notifications/handlers/submitPRNotification.ts
```

**Root Cause:** Dynamic imports using `await import()` were failing in the development environment due to module resolution issues.

**Solution:** Converted dynamic import to static import at the top of the file:
```typescript
import { SubmitPRNotificationHandler } from './notifications/handlers/submitPRNotification';
```

### 3. PR Details Enhancements
**Added Features:**
- Display of Purchase Order Number in PR details
- Improved total amount display with enhanced styling
- Better visual separation of line items

## Files Modified

### `src/services/notification.ts`
- Added missing status transition mappings to `functionMap`
- Ensures all valid PR status transitions have proper notification handlers

### `src/services/pr.ts`
- Converted dynamic import to static import for `SubmitPRNotificationHandler`
- Added `purchaseOrderNumber` field to `getPR` function return value
- Improved error handling for notification failures

### `src/types/pr.ts`
- Added `purchaseOrderNumber?: string` field to `PRRequest` interface
- Ensures type safety for the new field throughout the application

### `src/components/pr/PRDetails.tsx`
- Fixed incorrect property reference from `currentPR.items` to `currentPR.lineItems`
- Added display for Purchase Order Number
- Enhanced total amount display with improved styling and formatting

## Testing
✅ Successfully tested PR submission notifications (email sent correctly)
✅ Successfully tested status transition notifications for `SUBMITTED->IN_QUEUE`
✅ All notification handlers properly registered and functioning

## Technical Details

### Status Transition Map
The complete `functionMap` now includes:
```typescript
'NEW->SUBMITTED': sendNewPRNotification
'SUBMITTED->IN_QUEUE': sendStatusChangeNotification
'SUBMITTED->REVISION_REQUIRED': sendRevisionRequiredNotification
'SUBMITTED->CANCELED': sendStatusChangeNotification
'SUBMITTED->PENDING_APPROVAL': sendPendingApprovalNotification
'IN_QUEUE->PENDING_APPROVAL': sendPendingApprovalNotification
'IN_QUEUE->REJECTED': sendStatusChangeNotification
'IN_QUEUE->REVISION_REQUIRED': sendRevisionRequiredNotification
'REVISION_REQUIRED->SUBMITTED': sendResubmittedNotification
'PENDING_APPROVAL->APPROVED': sendApprovedNotification
'PENDING_APPROVAL->REJECTED': sendRejectedNotification
```

### Import Resolution
Changed from:
```typescript
const { SubmitPRNotificationHandler } = await import('./notifications/handlers/submitPRNotification');
```

To:
```typescript
import { SubmitPRNotificationHandler } from './notifications/handlers/submitPRNotification';
// ...
const notificationHandler = new SubmitPRNotificationHandler();
```

## Impact
- ✅ All PR status transitions now properly trigger notifications
- ✅ PR submission notifications work reliably
- ✅ Better error handling prevents notification failures from blocking PR operations
- ✅ Enhanced PR details display with purchase order tracking

## Notes
- Dynamic imports were problematic in the development environment but may work in production builds
- Static imports are more reliable for the current use case
- All notification failures are logged but don't prevent PR creation/updates from succeeding
